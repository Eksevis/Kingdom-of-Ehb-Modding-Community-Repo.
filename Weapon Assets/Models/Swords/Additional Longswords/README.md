# Experimental Longswords

Just a couple of longswords that I was working on at one point. Most can use existing meshes, and the last one has a tweaked version:


- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_200 -> model: m_w_swd_018
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_201 -> model: m_w_swd_018
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_202 -> model: m_w_swd_020
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_203 -> model: m_w_swd_020
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_204 -> model: m_w_swd_020
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_205 -> model: m_w_swd_023
- b_gui_ig_i_w_swd_206 -> model: m_w_swd_200 (new model, slight change of m_w_swd_023)


An optional template .gas for the swords included for reference
